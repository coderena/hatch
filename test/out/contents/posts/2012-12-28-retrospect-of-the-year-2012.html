              <div class="span7"><p>The year 2012 was an unusal year. As a sophomore in the self-employed battlefield, I experienced a lot this year, and learned my lessons. </p>
<p>If you ask what the biggest lesson I&#39;ve learned, I would say - the only thing unchanged is the change itself, you need to prepare for it and adapt to it. For the year 2012, the obvious changes for the team were:</p>
<ul>
<li>We lose a key team member and it hurt me a lot.</li>
<li>We acquired fresh blood and that was a great shot.</li>
<li>We had to cut down the size of the team to move faster. Believe me, I felt much more paintful than anyone else. For the whole month I was in anguish until everyone paved to their new journey.</li>
<li>We built a series of city guide apps, which got passionate responses from our users. One of the apps, Hong Kong Travel Guide, held a position of No. 1 in travel leaderboard of Hong Kong app market for a period, which was a wonderful thing considering that we spent <strong>$0</strong> to market it.</li>
<li>We successfully built our next gen software and would launch it formally early next year.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->

<p>There were several great changes on me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I finished one of the greatest upgrade in my life - my lovely baby, lingxi, born at the end of this year.</li>
<li>I read tens of books but most of them were not in CS field. This year I began to be obsessed by philosophy and literature of the pre-Qin period, so I read quite a few on that.</li>
<li>I started using Meteor, a great nodejs framework for next gen web applications. By using Meteor, I spent about 5 nights on creating a collaboration tool for my team. Now this tool, called teamspark, is the defacto collaboration software of the team.</li>
<li>I started blogging again. This time, by using octopress and sublime, I was totally immersed in the joyous composing state.</li>
<li>I changed my little red elf Palio to a medium-sized car. For my baby, of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like what I&#39;ve done for the past years, this retrospection will be divided into several parts, including work, study, life and finance. I&#39;ll try to make it more personal.</p>

<h2 id="study">Study</h2>
<h3 id="frontend-tech">frontend tech</h3>
<p>For frontend bolerplate, I studied <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap</a>, and kept an eye open on <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 bolerplate</a>.</p>
<p>For javascript,</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest surprise is <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a>.</li>
<li>I became a fan of <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a> but looking forward to <a href="http://lodash.com/">lodash</a>.</li>
<li>I liked the simplicity of <a href="http://backbonejs.org">backbone</a> but finally I chose <a href="http://emberjs.com">ember</a> for my projects.</li>
<li>After seeking for many local storage packages, I locked down to <a href="http://amplifyjs.com/">amplify</a>.</li>
<li>I learned <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a> and <a href="http://tchen.me/blog/2012/12/26/reveal-js-support-for-octopress/">embedded it</a> into octopress for easy slide composition.</li>
<li>I played with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> and <a href="http://nvd3.org/">nvd3</a> in the project teamspark for displaying statistics charts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backend-tech">Backend tech</h3>
<ul>
<li>The biggest surprise is Meteor, too.</li>
<li>I began to fight in the nodejs battlefield.</li>
<li>I reread <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a> for grouping my knowledge fragments about HTTP.</li>
<li>I mastered the technique of seamlessly deploying.</li>
<li>Though we switched our major server for <a href="http://tukeq.com">tukeq.com</a> from AWS to local IDC (you know the reason) and removed almost all services outside mainland China (such as cloudflare) for about a year, I still payed close attenttion to technologies used by AWS, Cloudflare, Mixpanel, Optimizely, etc.</li>
<li>I switched DB server from mongodb back to mysql for company&#39;s projects but mongodb is still my favorite for personal projects.</li>
<li>&quot;Generate to static&quot; technology like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> caught my attention, and I did spend quite a few time on it.</li>
<li>I picked up my C / assembly / Makefile experience again, and use makefile in my projects for a kind of automation.</li>
<li>I started to read several hot open source code like redis which in pure C.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="books-i-read-for-my-personal-interest">Books I read for my personal interest</h3>
<ul>
<li>History: I read several books regarding history. For the first time in my life, I finished reading <strong>史记</strong>.</li>
<li>Literature: I reread <strong>三国演义</strong> and <strong>水浒</strong> (including <strong>金圣叹批读水浒传</strong>).</li>
<li>Philosophy: I read <strong>老子</strong>, <strong>论语</strong>, <strong>荀子</strong>, <strong>庄子</strong>. I like <strong>庄子</strong> the most.</li>
<li>Biography: I read <strong>李鸿章传</strong> and <strong>王安石传</strong> (not finished) by <em>梁启超</em>. <strong>李鸿章传</strong> might be the best biography I&#39;ve read so far. It did a lot of interesting comparisons among Li and other politician, like Bismarck in Germany.</li>
<li>Science: I read quite a few psychology books like <strong>职业心理学</strong> (translated by <em>邹韬奋</em>) and several books about common sense, like <strong>The Story of Mankind</strong> by <em>Hendrik Willem van Loon</em>.</li>
<li>Others: I read <strong>三字经</strong>, <strong>Aespo&#39;s Fables</strong>, <strong>Grimm&#39;s Fairy Tales</strong>, and <strong>Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales</strong>, both for me and for my lovely baby. The <strong>Aespo&#39;s Fables</strong> taught me a lot.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<h3 id="lingxi-was-born">Lingxi was born</h3>
<p>My wife got pregnant early in this year. That was an unexpected pleasure. After a ten-month growing, bringing us many, many joys and pains, this little creature jumped out to this world finally. Since then she became the center of the family. </p>
<p>I would spend as much as time on her education. I knew I could bring her a plentiful life but what I concerned the most was the richness of her spirit.</p>
<h3 id="boring-but-peaceful-prenatal-life">Boring but peaceful prenatal life</h3>
<p>I watched 0 movie, 0 play and 0 game this year. I did several excursions to 北戴河, 十渡, 红螺寺, 大觉寺 but made 0 long journey.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-five-year-wedding-anniversary">THE first five-year WEDDING anniversary</h3>
<p>My wif got pregnant on the same day of our five-year anniversary. Thanks to god&#39;s mercy!</p>
<h2 id="finance">Finance</h2>
<p>As self-employed, I took 0 or low salary for the past 2 years for the good of the company. Fortunately, the family&#39;s incoming could cover the expenses. We lead a much tighter life than 2 years ago but we were much happier than before. <em>孔子</em> once said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>君子谋道不谋食，忧道不忧贫。</p>
<p>士志于道，而耻恶衣恶食者，未足与议也。</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>You may ask why I wrote this in English, is it a kind of show-off? No. There are two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This blog is written for myself. It&#39;s not intended to get other&#39;s comments.</li>
<li>Just before I started to write, I got an inspiration - I&#39;ve not used English for quite a long time, why not write it in English to see what&#39;s the current status? </li>
</ol>
